Hi there 👋 I'm Jimmy Lucas 🌟

Currently residing in Barcelona, Spain 🌆

🔬 I am a Bioinformatician and Data Scientist. My expertise focuses on microbial evolution, multi-drug resistance (MDR), and microbial community dynamics. 🧬

💬 Ask me about microbiology, evolutionary biology, and community dynamics, or check out my latest microbiology project repositories on GitHub!

🧗‍♂️ When I'm not coding or analyzing data, I'm probably climbing or on some spontaneous adventure.

📱 In my free time, I apply my data science skills to create personal app projects that solve everyday challenges.

📘 I am actively exploring innovative technologies and methodologies in bioinformatics to enhance microbiological research.

🎧 To relax, I enjoy grabbing something to eat, walking around Barcelona, or listening to music to unwind.
